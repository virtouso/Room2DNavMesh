Room 2D NavMesh
as you may know, unity NavMesh does not support 2d environments and there is not a good free plugin for path finding in 2d games.
its a simplistic 2d navmesh that helps you make you navigation system in unity 2d in seconds. its in primary versions and will be added many updates to this but now its fully functional.

it also supports multi agents.
